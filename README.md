I am learning to actually *build* things with Swift. [The O'Reilly Book is good; you should buy it.](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920045946.do)

This is basically all *their* code, though I'm feeling free to tweak, hack, etc. as I go, to make it more the way I'd prefer and to fit my own sensibilities.
